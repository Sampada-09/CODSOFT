# CODSOFT
Hello and thank you for visiting my Data Science Internship Portfolio! This repository is a showcase of various projects completed during my internship at Codsoft, highlighting my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and effective problem-solving


# ABOUT PROJECT
1. TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION: Utilize the Titanic dataset for a beginner-level project, predicting passenger survival. The dataset includes individual information like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

2. MOVIE RATING PREDICTION USING PYTHON: Develop a model that anticipates a movie's rating by considering features such as genre, director, and actors. Utilize regression techniques to address this challenge.

3. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION: The Iris flower dataset comprises three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species are identifiable through various measurements. Picture having measurements for Iris flowers already sorted by their specific species. The goal is to create a machine learning model capable of learning from these measurements and effectively categorizing Iris flowers into their respective species.

4. SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON:The prediction of car sales entails estimating the quantity of a product customers will buy, considering factors like advertising spending, audience segmentation, and the choice of advertising platforms. hese professionals employ Python-based machine learning techniques to scrutinize and comprehend data, enabling them to make well-informed decisions about advertising expenditures. By utilizing these forecasts, businesses can fine-tune their advertising strategies and enhance their sales opportunities.
